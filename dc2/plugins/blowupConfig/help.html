<p>Modifying Blowup theme configuration allows you to customize your theme very easily. To do so, simply fill in the configuration fields or choose a predefined style.</p>

<h3>Colors</h3>

<p>When you have to enter a color value, you should use the hexadecimal format. For example: "#FF0000" will give you red. You may also use the color picker located next to every color field.</p>
<p>If you lack inspiration, try and visit the following pages:</p>

</ul>

<h3>Measurement units</h3>

<p>When you have to indicate a size, it must be followed by a measurement unit. For example: "1em". If you do not include the unit, pixels will be used as default measurement unit.</p>
<p>The following measurement units are available:</p>
<ul>
  <li>px</li>
  <li>em</li>
  <li>ex</li>
  <li>pt</li>
  <li>%</li>
</ul>

<h3>Header images</h3>

<p>You can choose a header image among the list to use in place of the default one.</p>

<p>When you choose "Custom..." in the image list, you will be able to upload your own image. <strong>The image file must be in JPG or PNG format and must be precisely 800px wide.</strong>

<p>If you upload a JPG image, a border will be added to the image, which is not the case with PNG images (the transparency of which will also be kept).</p>

<h3>Predefined styles</h3>

<p>You can choose a predefined style in the "Predefinite styles" drop-down list.
Once you have chosen the style, you have to submit the form to apply the modifications.</p>

<p>You may then modify the predefined style according to your taste and needs.</p>

<h3>Configuration import / export</h3>

<p>At the end of Blowup options, you can display an area names "Configuration import/export". This text area contains the configuration you are currently using. You can copy it to share it with others.</p>

<p>To apply (import) a configuration, you simply need to replace the content of the text area with the configuration you want to use. Don't forget to click on "apply code".</p>
